"""
Add copy to clipboard from IPython!
To install, just copy it to your profile/startup directory, typically:

    ~/.ipython/profile_default/startup/

Example usage:

    %copy hello world
    # will store "hello world"
    a = [1, 2, 3]
    %copy a
    # will store "[1, 2, 3]"

You can also use it with cell magic

    In [1]: %%copy
       ...: Even multi
       ...: lines
       ...: work!
       ...:

If you don't have a variable named 'copy' you can rely on automagic:

    copy hey man
    a = [1, 2, 3]
    copy a
